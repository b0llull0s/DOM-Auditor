# DOM1n8
DOM1n8 is a security auditing tool designed to detect potential vulnerabilities in your web application by scanning HTML and JavaScript files. It uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) for deep JavaScript analysis and regex-based checks to identify common dangerous patterns and potential DOM clobbering issues. The tool can help developers identify issues related to DOM manipulation, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and unsafe user input handling.
